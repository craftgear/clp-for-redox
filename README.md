These are 1.25u version of fabulous [CLP Keycaps](https://github.com/vvhg1/clp-keycaps).
For those who drive Redox and its varieties.

Kudos to vvhg1 and braindefender(who designed the original [KLP Lame Keycaps](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps/)).

I can't get a hang of Fusion360 so I use [Plasticity](https://www.plasticity.xyz/) to resize them.

Enjoy.
